The story follows Asterix and Obelix, two Gaulish warriors who live in a village that resists the Roman occupation with the help of a magic potion that gives them super strength. In this adventure, they travel to India to find a rare ingredient for their potion: dal, a type of lentil. Along the way, they encounter various cultures, dangers and surprises.
 
The book is a humorous parody of Indian stereotypes and history, as well as a tribute to the original Asterix series. The book features references to Bollywood, cricket, yoga, Gandhi, Taj Mahal and other aspects of Indian culture. The book also includes some Bengali words and phrases, such as "namaskar", "bhalo" and "roshogolla".
 
Daler Khoje Asterix is one of the many adaptations of Asterix in different languages and countries. The original French title of the book is AstÃ©rix chez RahÃ zade, which means Asterix at Rahazade's. Rahazade is a fictional character based on Scheherazade, the storyteller of One Thousand and One Nights.
 
The book is a fun and entertaining read for fans of Asterix and Bengali comics alike. It is also a rare example of cross-cultural exchange between France and India through comics.

Some of the characters and situations in Daler Khoje Asterix are inspired by the original Asterix comics, while others are unique to the Bengali version. For example, the villain of the story is a Roman governor named Rajah Watzit, who is based on Julius Caesar. He wants to capture Asterix and Obelix and use them as gladiators in his arena. He also has a pet tiger named Shere Khan, who is a reference to the character from The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling.
 
Another character who appears in the book is Rahazade, a beautiful princess who is the daughter of Rajah Watzit. She falls in love with Asterix and helps him and Obelix escape from her father's palace. She also introduces them to her friend Guru Bhairo Baba, a wise and eccentric yogi who teaches them how to meditate and levitate. He also gives them a clue about where to find dal in India.
 
The book also features some cameo appearances by famous Indian personalities, such as Amitabh Bachchan, Sachin Tendulkar, Indira Gandhi and Mother Teresa. They are depicted as friends or allies of Asterix and Obelix, who help them in their quest. For example, Amitabh Bachchan is a famous actor who disguises himself as a Roman soldier to infiltrate Rajah Watzit's palace. Sachin Tendulkar is a cricket player who teaches Asterix and Obelix how to play the sport. Indira Gandhi is a politician who leads a peaceful protest against the Roman occupation. Mother Teresa is a nun who runs an orphanage where Asterix and Obelix find some dal.
